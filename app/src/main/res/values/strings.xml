    <string name="snippet_upland_ponds">These ponds were made by people but the animals quickly moved in.  You can see small tadpoles and fish along the warm edges.  Look carefully and you may be able to see a bullfrog lurking in the shallows as well.  Bullfrogs are not native to this area but love to eat the tadpoles and other creatures in these ponds.  If the bullfrogs jump you may hear them make a funny “squeak” sound.</string>

    <string name="snippet_bee_boxes">The large house like boxes you see are homes for Mason Bees. These bees don’t make honey and they don’t sting but they do a great job of pollinating all the flowers you see around you. The bees emerge from their cocoons in the spring. They build a nest in narrow holes. Females visit flowers to gather pollen and nectar. The bee lays an egg. Then, she creates a wall of mud, which doubles as the back of the next cell. The process continues until she has filled the cavity. By the summer, the larva has consumed all of its provisions and begins spinning a cocoon around itself.  How many of the tubes in the houses look like they are full?  If you were a bee which flowers in this garden would you like best?</string>
