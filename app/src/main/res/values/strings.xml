    <string name="snippet_upland_ponds">These ponds were made by people but the animals quickly moved in.  You can see small tadpoles and fish along the warm edges.  Look carefully and you may be able to see a bullfrog lurking in the shallows as well.  Bullfrogs are not native to this area but love to eat the tadpoles and other creatures in these ponds.  If the bullfrogs jump you may hear them make a funny “squeak” sound.</string>
